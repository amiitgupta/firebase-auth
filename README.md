Ready project files to from the live webinar on firebase auth on march 14, 2021.
steps to make it your project:
step 1: add your firebase configuration code at bottom of index.html file just before closing body tag, once you started a firebase project app.
In your firebase console, make sure you enable login with email and password option and also password-less login with google login.

1. Add, password visibility toggle button to register and login forms
2. Add, confirm password feature to update password modal
3. Add, function to upload and show user profile picture and mobile number
4. Make the user name display to navbar too once a user is logged in
5. Make some DOM manipulation on whether a user had verified their email. If not, then show a message to verify their mail on accessing that link
6. Send email verification mail when a user updates their email id.
7. And also if any improvements you feel we can make, try to do that too (do atleast one).
